 	<p><font color=yellow size=5><center>Binary is the language of the computer as I am sure we all know it is represented with 1s and 0s.
 	 1 represents Yes or that the computer has received an electrical signal. 
 	 0 represents No or how the computer has not been given an electrical signal.
 	  As seen in the chart above Binary is easy. Every column the bit is in is multiplied by 2.
 	   If there is a 1 you add the number the bit represents If there is a 0 you ignore it.
 	    For example 1001001 is 146 We then assign things like letters to certain binary numbers For example A is 01000001 or 129. 
 	    It would be very inconvenient for programmers to work in binary so computer scientists made code like php and html to make a bridge between binary and our language. </center></font></p>
