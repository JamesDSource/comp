  <p><font color=yellow size=5><center>In most computers there are two processing units.
   The central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU).
    It is also possible to have a CPU that also acts like a GPU so you only need one. 
    Despite being in the same category they are very different. 
    Processing units are the parts of the computer that carry out programs and do all the work.
     There clock speed or the amount of frequencies each core can output per second is measured in hertz (Hz). 
     Each processor can also have a different amount of cores. 
     A CPU will have a low amount of cores with a very high clock speed for example the Ryzen 1700x has a base clock speed of 3.4 GHz (34000000000 frequencies per second) and 8 cores. 
     GPUs usually have a low clock speed and a lot of cores for example the gtx 1080ti one of the more expensive GPUs has about 3584 cores and a clock speed of 1582 MHz (1582000000 frequencies per second).
      Contrary to popular belief a GPU is NOT a Graphics card. A GPU is the chip inside of a graphics card.</center><font></p>
