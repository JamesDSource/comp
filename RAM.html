<p><font color=black size=5><center><mark>In a computer lots of parts works together.
 The random access memory works very closely with the central processing unit.
  The RAM uses logic gates to trap code in memory cells. Different types of RAM have different memory cells.
   For example VRAM is a type of RAM in the graphics card that works closely with the graphics processing unit (GPU). 
   Certain RAM may be ddr1-6. Ddr stands for double data rate because the RAM reads and writes data really fast in and out. 
   The most common RAM in most common computers is ddr3 and ddr4. The most common VRAM in most modern graphics cards is ddr5.
    The RAMs job is to load information into the processing unit. GPUs while still processing units work much differently than CPUs.
     This is why the GPU needs much different RAM than the CPU.</mark></center><font></p>
