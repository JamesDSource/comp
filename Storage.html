<h1><center><font size=60>Hard Drives</font></center></h1> 
<p><font color=yellow size=5><center>A Mechanical hard drive uses spinning disks to store lots of information.
 Modern day hard drives can usually store 500-2000Gb of storage. Some of the more expensive hard drives can store 5-10Tb.
  All of the this affordable storage does come with some nasty downfalls. To start Hard drives are fragile.
   If you shake around or drop a hard drive the disk could get messed up by the Actuator and brake the drive. 
   Hackers can also make a virus that will make the Actuator to move wildly destroying the hard drives disk. 
   Hard drives are also generally not very fast when opening up applications or operating systems.</center><font></p>
<h1><center><font size=60>Solid State drives and M.2 drives</font></center></h1>
<p><font color=yellow size=5><center>The alternative to a hard drive a SSD fixes most of these downfalls. A solid state drive does not use spinning disks to store information so they are much more reliable when storing information. They also have much faster read and write speeds making applications open much faster when stored on an SSD. Another type of SSD is an M.2 drive these are much faster than regular SSDs because M.2 drives are much closer to the CPU and RAM than a regular SSD. The problem is only some motherboards allow support for M.2 drives. The only problem with SSDs is the price they are very expensive. While there are 10Tb SSDs most people will only be able to afford up to a 450Gb SSD.</center></font></p>
