  <p><font color=yellow size=5><center></center>The Power supply is the component inside the computer that supplies power.
   Itâ€™s job is to take in AC power (Alternating current) and convert it to DC power (Direct Current) then send that power into the computer.
    The wattage you need is determined by the parts in your computer and can range from 150 to 1200 watts.
     Sometimes however the advertised wattage is not always the wattage it will output. Many PSUs will say 80+ on them. 
     This means it will output at the very least 80% of the advertised wattage at one time.
      They will also be given a rating like Gold or Platinum. This determines the efficiency of the power supply.
       Power supplies are also very dangerous to take apart. There is a part inside the PSU called the capacitors.
        If you where to touch these while they are still surging with electricity you would probably die.<font></p>
