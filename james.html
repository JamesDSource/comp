<h1><center><font size=60>About the Author</font></center></h1> 
<p><font color=yellow size=5><center>James Duran was born in upper north korea where he raised a family in order to get into a russian labor camp. 
Once he got into the russian labor camp he found his first chance to escape. 
Of course when he escaped from the camp the North Korean government held his family hostage and killed them. 
Once he escaped from Russia he made his way to france where he discovered radioactive decay and shared a nobel prize with his lab partner Marie Curie.
 Once he got bored living in his mansion he gave all of his riches to the poor and set off to the Americas. 
 Once he realized he gave 99.999% of his money to the poor and could not afford to travel by boat or plane he walked to the shore of england.
  He then swam to the Americas into California winning the world record for longest swim.
   In California he built up his riches again purely by running car washes and shoe shining. 
   Then from there he enrolled and made it into the South Pasadena high school. </center></font></p>
